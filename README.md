# ðŸ‘· `cloudflare-worker` URL Shortener

For the Cloudflare Developer
Summer Challenge, I decided to take advantage of the [Cloudflare Worker](https://www.cloudflare.com/workers/) functionality along with the key value storage offered by [Workers KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/) to create a URL shortener. The application is then deployed using [Workers Sites](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-sites).

The application is a simple HTTP API that allows you to input a URL and create a short URL that redirects to the original URL.
